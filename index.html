		<section>
			<p>I have been combining my passion for software development with a keen interest in IT security for some time.</p>

			<p>I have been contemplating writing a technical blog with IT security content. Year 2021 may finally be the year to make it happen. Wish me luck! If it happens, it will happen here. If you are looking for the CVE-2020-15711 advisory, take a look <a href="CVE-2020-15711.html">here</a>.</p>
